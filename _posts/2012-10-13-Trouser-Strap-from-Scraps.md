My first sewing project of any interest was a simple trouser strap. A trouser
strap is used while biking to keep the lower right pant leg from flapping
around and catching on the chainring teeth and causing a potentially
embarrassing, and most likely painful crash.  I had no pattern, just some
scraps of bright red fabric, some sticky backed hook and loop and a basic idea
of how I wanted the strap to work.

The fabric had quite a bit of top stitching adorning it as it was used as test
material while I was fiddling with the tensions on my new Pfaff 130.

The scrap was wide but not long enough to go around my leg so I cut it into two
pieces and just stitched them together to get the proper length. A few folds to
get rid of raggedy edges, a bit of hook and loop and one final topstitch and it
was done.

One important hint about hook and loop... Don't buy the sticky back stuff if
you intend to sew it. The glue sticks to the needle and makes it difficult for
the needle to slip through the material easily. It was enough to stall the
motor on the machine.
