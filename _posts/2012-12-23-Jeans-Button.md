Sometimes projects get put off... way off. My wife asked me if I could sew the
button back onto her jeans a long time ago, 6-12 months ago. Somehow the
simplest little projects are the hardest to get done. I generally have a rule
that if a project takes less than 2 minutes I just do it. I don't write it down
on a list or put it off at all, I just do it. Sewing a button back on jeans is
more like a 3 minute project and I don't have any rules for that so finally I'm
making the time to finish this up.

I wanted a button that was kind of cool looking and not just a plain old button
like the one that came on the jeans. Jo-Ann's had some that were just about 
the right size and had a cool design on them as well.

I used some *Coats Extra Strong* nylon thread and a large enough needle to
accommodate.

First thing to do is tie a knot or two in the end of the thread so that it
won't pull through the fabric. 

Starting from underneath the fabric I made a series of about 10 loops up and
over the button hook until it felt secure enough to be tugged on.

The last thing to do was to tie off the loose end of the thread. I just pushed
the needle under some of the loops on the back side of the fabric and made a
few knots.

Voil√†! Three
minutes and the button was done.
