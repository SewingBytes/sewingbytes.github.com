title: About me

Hi, my name is Tim and I like to make things...everything. I am an ASIC
(Application Specific Integrated Circuit) designer by day. What in the world is
that?  You know those little black "computer chips" that are in everything you
use every day? Those are ASICs, and I write the code that describes the
functionality inside those chips. Being an ASIC designer is one of those
careers where if you do not absolutely love what you do you would go freaking
crazy. ASIC design is tedious, complicated, frustrating, painful and completely
amazing. I have a little company named [RTLCores](http://rtlcores.com) where we
design and sell the basic building blocks used in ASICs.

Sometimes I have to pull myself away from the keyboard and actually get my
hands dirty on projects that require a different kind of craftsmanship. Sewing
is one of those activities. I'm fairly new to sewing and am learning it all by
trial and error (the best way to learn) as well as with some help from friends.
I'm even in a sewing group with some of the mommies from my wifes mommies
group. None of the other husbands are manly enough to join in thus far.  I
started this blog at the suggestion of the woman who hosts our sewing group,
Trihn. It's a place to catalog and describe the projects I've worked on, and
to show off some cool sewing machines as well. I hope you enjoy it.
